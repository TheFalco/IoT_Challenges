# Internet of Things Home Challenges
*These challanges have been developed as part of the "Internt of Things" course at [Politecnico di Milano](https://www.polimi.it/).*

## Collaborators
The challenges were developed by [Matteo Falconi](https://github.com/TheFalco "Visit Matteo's GitHub") and [Davide Fiozzi](https://github.com/davidefiozzi "Visit Davide's GitHub").
## Structure
The repository is organized as follow:
- __HomeChallenge1__:  
This folder contains the first Home Challenge: A Cooja simulation written in *nesC* that simulates three TinyOS (sky) motes that communicate over the radio.
- __HomeChallenge2__:  
This folder contains the second Home Challenge: A Wireless Sensor Network simulation with TOSSIM that simulate 2 motes talking between each other.
- __HomeChallenge5__ :  
This folder contains the fifth Home Challenge: A Cooja simulation written in *nesC* that simulates three TinyOS (sky) motes that communicate over the radio. Motes 2 and 3 send random values to mote 1 which receives them and ’’forwards’’ them to Node-RED; value below 70 will be display in ThingSpeak via MQTT.

_Challenges 3 and 4 did not require any code, for this reason they won't be present in the repo._
